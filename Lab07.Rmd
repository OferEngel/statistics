In 2004, the state of North Carolina released a large data set containing information on births recorded in this state.
This data set is useful to researchers studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. We will work with a random sample of observations from this data set.

# Learning goals

-   Constructing confidence intervals
-   Conducting hypothesis tests
-   Interpreting confidence intervals and results of hypothesis tests in context of the data


## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation, the **tidymodels** package for inference, and the data lives in the **dsbox** package.
These packages are already installed for you.
You can load them by running the following in your Console:

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(kableExtra)
set.seed(123)
# library(tidymodels)
# library(openintro)
```

## Data

In 2004, the state of North Carolina released to the public a large data set containing information on births recorded in this state. This data set has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. This is a random sample of 1,000 cases from this data set. A data frame with 1000 observations on the following 13 variables. This lab assignment is based on Wen, Shi Wu, Michael S. Kramer, and Robert H. Usher." [Comparison of birth weight distributions between Chinese and Caucasian infants](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/141/12/1177/148415?login=false)." American Journal of Epidemiology 141.12 (1995): 1177-1187.

```{r}

tribble(
  ~name, ~description, 
  "fage", "Father's age in years", 
  "mage", "Mother's age in years.", 
  "mature", "Maturity status of mother.",
  "weeks", "Length of pregnancy in weeks.",
  "premie", "Whether the birth was classified as premature (premie) or full-term.",
  "visits", "Number of hospital visits during pregnancy.",
  "gained","Weight gained by mother during pregnancy in pounds",
  "weight", "Weight of the baby at birth in pounds.",
  "lowbirthweight", "Whether baby was classified as low birthweight `low` or not `not low`.",
  "gender", "Gender of the baby, `female` or `male.`",
  "habit", "Status of the mother as a `nonsmoker` or a `smoker`.",
  "marital", "Whether mother is `married` or `not married` at birth.",
  "whitemom", "Whether mom is `white` or `not white`"
) %>%  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

```




### Prepare 

In this lab we'll be generating random samples. This means that every time you sample, you will get different results. To avoid having the samples change every time you knit your document you set a seed. The seed makes sure that although the random sampling will repeat itself the same way, every time you run the code.


```{r show-setup, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

library(tidyverse) 
library(kableExtra)
set.seed(____)

```


# Exercises

1.  What are the cases in this data set? How many cases are there in our sample?

    *   The first step in the analysis of a new dataset is getting acquainted with the data. Create distribution plots for the important variables, paying attention to both categorical and numerical variables. For numerical variables, are there outliers? If you aren't sure or want to take a closer look at the data, make a graph.


A 1995 study (Wen, Kramer, and Usher, 1995) suggests that average weight of Caucasian babies born in the US is 3,369 grams (7.43 pounds). In this dataset we only have information on mother's race, so we will make the simplifying assumption that babies of Caucasian mothers are also Caucasian, i.e. `whitemom = "white"`.

We want to evaluate whether the average weight of Caucasian babies has changed since 1995.

Our null hypothesis should state "there is nothing going on", i.e. no change since 1995: $H_0: \mu = 7.43~pounds$.

Our alternative hypothesis should reflect the research question, i.e. some change since 1995.
Since the research question doesn't state a direction for the change, we use a two sided alternative hypothesis: $H_A: \mu \ne 7.43~pounds$.

2.  Create a filtered data frame called `ncbirths_white` that contain data only from white mothers. Then, calculate the mean of the weights of their babies.


::: { .RUsers }

Let's discuss how this test would work. Our goal is to simulate a null distribution of sample means that is centred at the null value of 7.43 pounds.In order to do so, we

-   take a bootstrap sample of from the original sample,
-   calculate this bootstrap sample's mean,
-   repeat these two steps a large number of times to create a bootstrap distribution of means centred at the observed sample mean,
-   shift this distribution to be centred at the null value by subtracting / adding X to all bootstrap mean (X = difference between mean of bootstrap distribution and null value), and
-   calculate the p-value as the proportion of bootstrap samples that yielded a sample mean at least as extreme as the observed sample mean.

::: 


3.  Run the appropriate hypothesis test, visualize the null distribution, calculate the p-value, and interpret the results in context of the data and the hypothesis test.

#### Baby weight vs. smoking

Consider the possible relationship between a mother's smoking habit and the weight of her baby.
Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

4.  Make side-by-side boxplots displaying the relationship between `habit` and `weight`. What does the plot highlight about the relationship between these two variables?

5.  Before moving forward, save a version of the dataset omitting observations where there are NAs for `habit`. You can call this version `ncbirths_habitgiven`.

The box plots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using the following to first group the data by the `habit` variable, and then calculate the mean `weight` in these groups using.

```{r habit-means, eval=FALSE}
ncbirths_habitgiven %>%
  group_by(habit) %>%
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

There is an observed difference, but is this difference statistically significant? In order to answer this question we will conduct a hypothesis test .

6.  Write the hypotheses for testing if the average weights of babies born to smoking and non-smoking mothers are different.

7.  Run the appropriate hypothesis test, calculate the p-value, and interpret the results in context of the data and the hypothesis test.

8. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the average weights of babies born to smoking and non-smoking mothers.

### Bonus questions: Baby weight vs. mother's age

In this portion of the analysis we focus on two variables.
The first one is `maturemom`.

9. First, a non-inference task: Determine the age cutoff for younger and mature mothers. Use a method of your choice, and explain how your method works.



10. The other variable of interest is `lowbirthweight`. Conduct a hypothesis test evaluating whether the proportion of low birth weight babies is higher for mature mothers. State the hypotheses, verify the conditions, run the test and calculate the p-value, and state your conclusion in context of the research question. Use $\alpha = 0.05$. If you find a significant difference, construct a confidence interval, at the equivalent level to the hypothesis test, for the difference between the proportions of low birth weight babies between mature and younger mothers, and interpret this interval in context of the data.

# Numeric literacy: Parks and procreation?

As lockdowns forced couples to ‚ÄúNetflix and chill‚Äù every night, it seemed plausible that covid-19 might lead to a baby boom. Instead, it has caused a bust. The 21 countries that have published data for January‚Äîthe first full month in which babies conceived during the first wave were due‚Äîreport, on average, 11% less births per 1,000 people than in January 2020, and 12% less than you would expect based on each country‚Äôs fertility trend in 2009-19. If this trend continues, the number of births prevented by the pandemic may exceed the death toll from covid-19.

Data are not yet available for poor countries, where most births occur. And rich-world fertility rates may rise soon, as pregnancies that began in the mid-2020 lull in covid-19 cases come to term. But it would take only a 7% drop in global fertility for a year‚Äîjust over half the decline in the data from January‚Äîfor the pandemic to have resulted in 10m fewer births. Such a reduction would equal our estimate of excess deaths caused by covid-19 (see Briefing).

There are lots of ways the pandemic could have cut fertility. Birth rates tend to track economic growth. Lockdowns have made dating difficult. And couples may have delayed having children to avoid hospitals or clinics that treat covid-19 patients.

Disentangling these factors‚Äô impact is tricky. Some places, such as Chile and Israel, saw stark declines in fertility; others, like Switzerland and Finland, eked out gains. In general, the worse a country‚Äôs covid-19 infection rate was, the more its birth rate fell. The same was true of lockdown stringency and of economic contraction.

However, one measure tracked fertility unusually well: the change in attendance at parks in January-April 2020, as reported by Google. This link is hard to interpret. Rather than park traffic itself raising birth rates, something else must be influencing both park visits and conceptions. Yet once you account for footfall at parks, neither infection rates nor gdp nor other mobility data improve predictions significantly.

### Questions: 

1. What do you notice?
    
    After studying the graph and reading the text, what details do you see in the graph that are unusual or surprising? Looking at it carefully and paying attention to detail, what can you get out of the graph that is not necessarily obvious at first glance
    
2. What do you wonder? 
    
    Try to formulate a question, related to the graph, something that you would genuinely like to know. Please state your question clearly: as in a statement that ends with a question mark. 
    
3. How does this relate to you and your community?

    Think of something that makes this graph relate to you personally or to your community, however defined. Make sure that you *do not* talk about something that relates the graph to everyone, no matter who they are, but only to members of *your* community, something *specific* that does not related to other communities. This is your opportunity to be creative!  
    
4. What‚Äôs going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph‚Äôs main idea.
