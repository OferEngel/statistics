3 Let's apply the formula to a concrete case...

If we add up all the numbers we get... 
If we use the formula we get ...




So let's say $q = 0.75$ and we have 

$$ 0.75^0 + 0.75 + 0.75^2 + .... + 0.75^{100} = S_{100} = \frac{0.75^{100}-1}{0.75-1} $$
So if we add them all up $0.75^0 + 0.75 + .. + 0.75^{100}$, we get `r sum(0.75^(0:100))`. 
Another way, is to use the formula: $\frac{0.75^{100}-1}{0.75-1}$ 
The result will be `r (0.75^100-1)/(0.75-1)`. 
We can see that whether we sum up the numbers or use the formula, we get the same result. 
Hooray!

1 Take a picture of yourself, your cat or something else that is personal to you. 
And explain what it is about: 
ANSWER HERE: 


2 Write a little introduction about your relationship with statistics and
sustainable organisations. Do you have any background in statistics? How would
learning statistics benefit you in the future?
ANSWER HERE: 

3. Use nested lists... 

3 For example, what are the things you are looking forward to? (add links, emphasis)
* A link to web-pages about anything you feel could be relevant
* Doing cool stuff with fonts, such as Using italic font to emphasize really important ideas!
Using bold fonts.
* A link to a video...!

Here is a table - oh now we need some code... 

I found the data here...

# Exercise 3: using mathematical notation in RMarkdown

Ok let's look for example at a geometric sequence. 
So we all know that if we have a geometric sequence like so:

$$ 1, q, q^2, q^3.... q^{100}  $$
The sum of the terms would then be...

$$ 1 + q + q^2 + q^3 +.... + q^{100} = S_{100} = \frac{q^{100}-1}{q-1} $$
So let's say $q = 0.75$ and we have 

$$ 0.75^0 + 0.75 + 0.75^2 + .... + 0.75^{100} = S_{100} = \frac{0.75^{100}-1}{0.75-1} $$
So if we add them all up $0.75^0 + 0.75 + .. + 0.75^{100}$, we get `r sum(0.75^(0:100))`. 
Another way, is to use the formula: $\frac{0.75^{100}-1}{0.75-1}$ 
The result will be `r (0.75^100-1)/(0.75-1)`. 
We can see that whether we sum up the numbers or use the formula, we get the same result. 
Hooray!
