Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic.
Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position.

Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world, offering about 500 thousands bicycles. Interest in these systems have grown due to their increasing importance in traffic control, environmental and health issues.

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the data being generated by these systems make them attractive for researchers: in contrast to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems.

This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. We might therefore be able to detect many  important events in the city by monitoring these data.

### Data wrangling

1.  Recode the `season` variable to be a factor with meaningful level names as outlined in the codebook, with spring as the baseline level.

<br/>

2.  Recode the binary variables `holiday` and `workingday` to be factors with levels no (0) and yes (1), with no as the baseline level.

<br/>

3.  Recode the `yr` variable to be a factor with levels 2011 and 2012, with 2011 as the baseline level.

<br/>

4.  Recode the `weathersit` variable as 1 - clear, 2 - mist, 3 - light precipitation, and 4 - heavy precipitation, with clear as the baseline.

<br/>

5.  Calculate raw temperature, feeling temperature, humidity, and windspeed as their values given in the dataset multiplied by the maximum raw values stated in the codebook for each variable. Instead of over-writing  the existing variables, create new ones with concise but informative names.

6.  Check that the sum of `casual` and `registered` adds up to `cnt` for each record. In your report, show the code you used in order to do verify this, and explain how you know that the two columns really add up to the third. You can fill in the code snippet below: 


```{r wrangling, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

bikes <- bikes %>% 
  # for q1 
  mutate(season=
           fct_recode(factor(season, levels=c("2","3","4","1")),
                        "spring"="2", 
                        "summer"="3", 
                        "autumn"="4", 
                        "winter"="1")) %>% 
  # for q2 
  mutate(holiday=fct_recode(as.factor(holiday),
                            "no"="0", 
                            "yes"="1")) %>% 
  mutate(workingday=fct_recode(as.factor(workingday),
                            "no"="0", 
                            "yes"="1")) %>% 
  # for q3 
  mutate(yr=fct_recode(as.factor(yr),
                            "2011"="0", 
                            "2012"="1")) %>% 
  # for q4
  mutate(weathersit=fct_recode(as.factor(weathersit),
                            "clear"="1", 
                            "mist"="2",
                            "light precipitation"="3", 
                            "heavy precipitation"="4" )) %>%
  # for q5
  mutate(raw.temp=temp*39, 
         raw.atemp=atemp*50, 
         raw.hum=hum*100, 
         raw.windspeed=windspeed*67) 
  

# for q6 
# bikes %>% 
#   mutate(is.true = (cnt == casual + registered)) %>% 
#   pull(is.true) %>% table()


```



::: { .SPSS }

One way of doing this is to create a new column that takes on the value `TRUE` if they add up and `FALSE` if not, and then checking if all values in that column are `TRUE`s.

But this is only one way, you might come up with another.

### Exploratory data analysis

7.  Recreate the following visualization, and interpret it in context of the data. **Hint:** You will need to use one of the variables you created above. The temperature plotted is the *feeling temperature*.

```{r fig.fullwidth = TRUE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
 
ggplot(bikes, aes(x = dteday, y = cnt, color = raw.atemp)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
    labs(
      title = "Bike rentals in DC, 2011 and 2012",
      subtitle = "Warmer temperatures associated with more bike rentals",
      x = "Date",
      y = "Bike renrals",
      color = "Temperature (C)"
    ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

You may want to use the code below, just make sure to fill in the missing expressions!

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(bikes, aes(x = ___, y = ___, color = raw.atemp)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
    labs(
      title    = "______________",
      subtitle = "______________",
      x        = "______________",,
      y        = "______________",
      color    = "______________") 

```

8.  Create a visualization displaying the relationship between bike rentals and season. *Interpret* the plot in context of the data. Your plot could look like the following:

```{r  echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

ggplot(bikes, aes(x = season, y = cnt, color = raw.atemp)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(
      title = "Bike rentals in DC, 2011 and 2012",
      subtitle = "Warmer seasons associated with more bike rentals",
      x = "Season",
      y = "Bike renrals"
    ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

### Modelling

9.  Fit a linear model predicting total daily bike rentals from daily temperature. 

    a. Write the linear model, 
    b. Interpret the slope and the intercept in context of the data. 
    c. Determine and interpret the $R^2$.

<br/>

10. Fit another linear model predicting total daily bike rentals from daily feeling temperature.
    
    a. Write the linear model, interpret the slope and the intercept in context of the data, and determine and interpret the $R^2$.

    b. Is temperature or feeling temperature a better predictor of bike rentals? Explain your reasoning.

<br/>

<br/>

### Bonus questions: 11 - 15

11. Fit a model predicting total daily bike rentals from season, year, whether the day is holiday or not, whether the day is a workingday or not, the weather category, temperature, feeling temperature, humidity, and windspeed. Show the estimated slopes and interecept. Record adjusted $R^2$ of the model.


```{r}

mdl <- lm(cnt ~ season + yr + holiday +
            workingday + weathersit + raw.temp + raw.hum + raw.windspeed, bikes)


```


::: { .SPSS }

To do this question, you need to estimate a model that has multiple independent variables (aka explanatory variables). The equation would look as follows:

$$
Y_{rentals}=b_0+b_1\cdot X_{season}+b_2\cdot X_{yr}~+b_3\cdot~X_{h.day}+b_4\cdot X_{wk.day}+ b_5\cdot X_{weather}+b_6\cdot X_{r.temp}+b_7\cdot X_{hum}+b_8\cdot X_{wind}
$$
:::


12. Write the linear models for holidays and non-holidays.
    
    a. Is the slope of temperature the same or different for these two models?
    b. How about the slope for feeling temperature? Why or why not?

<br/>

13. Interpret the slopes of the different seasons.


<br/>

14. According to this model, assuming everything else is the same, in which season does the model predict total daily bike rentals to be highest and which to be the lowest?

# Numeric literacy: Are meditation apps effective?

Smartphones are often blamed for contributing to stress and anxiety. But they may be an effective tool for improving mental health, too. Meditation apps such as [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) and [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) provide users with soothing audio, guided meditations and breathing exercises designed to improve mental well-being. A new paper suggests that their impact could be comparable to those of much costlier forms of in-person therapy.

Advik Shreekumar and Pierre-Luc Vautrey, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recruited 2,384 Americans from Facebook and Instagram to use Headspace. Using a set of detailed mental-health questionnaires, the authors found that, after four weeks, access to the app reduced the share of participants with moderate or severe anxiety by 13 percentage points, or 50%, compared to the control group (who were placed on a waiting list for the app). The share of participants with moderate or severe depression fell by 14 percentage points, or 47%, relative to the control group.

These results should be interpreted with caution. First, participants in the study were recruited based on their interest in trying Headspace. That resulted in a sample that was younger, more female, more educated and more left-wing than the general population. Nearly 85% of participants were women, 44% held graduate degrees and less than 3% identified as Republicans. Second, the study did not include a placebo. In clinical trials, participants are assigned to receive either the treatment or a placebo. In this study such an approach was “not easily implementable,” the authors wrote, which means the mere thought of receiving an effective treatment could have been enough to ease symptoms. 

The graphs below show the [cumulative distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXLVjCKVP7U) of anxiety and depression scores, according to the Generalized Anxiety Disorder seven-item scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively.Please study the graph below carefully, read the explanation and answer the questions below:

### Questions: 

1. What do you notice?
    
    After studying the graph and reading the text, what details do you see in the graph that are unusual or surprising? Looking at it carefully and paying attention to detail, what can you get out of the graph that is not necessarily obvious at first glance
    
2. What do you wonder? 
    
    Try to formulate a question, related to the graph, something that you would genuinely like to know. Please state your question clearly: as in a statement that ends with a question mark. 
    
3. How does this relate to you and your community?

    Think of something that makes this graph relate to you personally or to your community, however defined. Make sure that you *do not* talk about something that relates the graph to everyone, no matter who they are, but only to members of *your* community, something *specific* that does not related to other communities. This is your opportunity to be creative!  
    
4. What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.
